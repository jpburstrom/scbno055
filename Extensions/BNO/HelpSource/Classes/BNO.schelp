TITLE:: BNO
summary:: Read data from BNO055 IMU over i2c.
categories:: UGens > BELA
related:: Classes/AnalogIn, Classes/DigitalIn

DESCRIPTION::

An UGen to read data from the Bosch BNO055 IMU over i2c on the BELA board.

NOTE::
This UGen only works on BELA.
::

NOTE::
Calibration is more of an orientation normalization, and doesn't affect the raw accel/gyro/mag values.
::

WARNING:: Note that the magnetometer values might drift over time ::

CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: orientationKr
Get pitch, roll, and yaw as an array (in that order).

ARGUMENT::calibrate
Trigger orientation calibration. Calibration is done in two steps, first in a neutral position, then facing down. After the second calibration the orientation vector is normalized to the neutral position.

ARGUMENT::load
Load previously saved calibration data (path is currently hardcoded to code::~/.bnoCalibration::)

ARGUMENT::save
Save calibration data (path is currently hardcoded to code::~/.bnoCalibration::)

METHOD:: accelKr
Get accelerometer values (code::[x, y, z]::).

METHOD:: magKr
Get magnetometer values (code::[x, y, z]::).

METHOD:: gyroKr
Get angular velocity values (code::[x, y, z]::).


EXAMPLES::

code::
//X, Y and Z controlling three oscillators
x = { Mix(SinOsc.ar(BNO.accelKr.linlin(-1, 1, 220, 440)))  * 0.1.dup }.play

x.free;
